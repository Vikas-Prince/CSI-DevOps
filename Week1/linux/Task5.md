# üõ°Ô∏è Week 1 - Linux: Task 5

## üìå Task: Practice More Linux Commands (Essential for DevOps)

### üéØ Objective

To go beyond basic commands and explore system-level Linux operations using commands crucial for DevOps roles, categorized based on usage and real-world applicability.


## Downloading resources from internet

### Download Files from the Web

```bash
wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk17/0d1cfde4252546c6931946de8db48ee2/35/GPL/openjdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

```

### Transfer Data from or to a Server

```bash
curl http://13.233.116.0:80
```

## System Monitoring & Resource Usage

### Check Uptime
```bash
uptime
```
- Shows how long the system has been running, current time, number of users, and average load.

### Memory Usage
```bash
free -m
```
- Displays the amount of memory used and available on the system in megabytes.

### CPU & Process Monitoring
```bash
top
```
- Provides a real-time view of CPU usage, running processes, and memory load.

```bash
ps -aux
```
- Lists all running processes with details like process ID, user, and memory usage.

## üîß Service & Daemon Management

###  Manage Services
```bash
sudo systemctl status
```
-  Checks the status of all or a specific service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
- Starts the nginx service.


```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```
- Stops the nginx service.

```bash

### Check Repository
```bash
yum repolist
```
-  Lists all enabled repositories that yum can use.

### RPM Package Queries
```bash
rpm -qa              # List all installed packages
rpm -q httpd         # check package installed or not.
rpm -qi httpd        # Detailed package info
```
