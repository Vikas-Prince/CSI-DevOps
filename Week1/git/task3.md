# Week 1 - Git: Task 3

## ðŸ“Œ Task: Create a New Branch, Push Changes, and Merge via Pull Request

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Understand Git branching workflows by creating a feature branch, pushing changes to GitHub, and merging them into the main/master branch using a pull request.

---

### Step 1: Create a New Branch Locally

```bash
git checkout -b feature1
```

- This command creates and switches to a new branch called feature1.

### Step 2: Add a New File in the Feature Branch

```bash
touch newfile.txt
```

- File created in the feature branch

### Step 3: Stage and Commit the File

```bash
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "Added new file in feature1 branch"
```
