# ‚öñÔ∏è Week 2 ‚Äì Azure Networking: Task 6

## üìå Task: Create an Internal and External Load Balancer

## üéØ Objective

To understand how to distribute traffic efficiently within Azure using both **Internal** and **Public Load Balancers**. This setup helps in load distribution, high availability, and traffic management ‚Äî key concepts every DevOps engineer must know.

---

## Implementation

### Step 0: Resource Group Setup

- Created a dedicated **Resource Group** to logically group and manage all the related resources used for this task.

### Step 1: Set Up VNet & Backend Virtual Machines

To prepare for load balancing:

- ‚úÖ I deployed **two private Ubuntu VMs** in the same **VNet and subnet (`lb-subnet`)**
*This setup allows both VMs to communicate within the same network securely.*
- ‚úÖ Allowed **port 80 (HTTP)** traffic through NSG
*Opening port 80 lets the web servers receive HTTP requests.*
- ‚úÖ Attached a **NAT Gateway** so I could install necessary packages
*The NAT Gateway provides outbound internet access without exposing the VMs directly to the internet.*

- Instead of assigning public IPs (which is not a best practice for security), I used **Azure Bastion**. Bastion provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over SSL, without exposing the VMs to the public internet.

*This keeps the VMs secure by avoiding public IP exposure but still allows easy access for management.*

- I successfully logged into both vm's using bastion host

- Once connected, I installed **Apache Web Server** on both VMs as the sample application.

## Part A: External Load Balancer

### Step 2: Create Public IP

- Created a **Static Public IP** named `public-lb-ip`. This IP will be used as the frontend IP for the external load balancer. A static IP ensures the IP doesn‚Äôt change even if the load balancer is restarted.

### Step 3: Create External Load Balancer
Creating the external load balancer allows incoming internet traffic to be distributed across backend VMs.
- Went to **Load Balancers ‚Üí Create**
- Named it: `external-lb`
- Selected **Public** as the type
- Assigned the previously created **static public IP**
- Region: Central India
- SKU: Standard

![external-lb](./snapshots/task6-lb-basics.jpg)


### Step 4: Frontend IP Configuration
- Configured the frontend with the previously created static public IP. This is the IP users will hit from the browser to access the application.

- This makes the load balancer accessible to external clients.

### Step 5: Backend Pool Configuration

- Added both Linux VMs manually to the **backend pool**. Selected the network interface (NIC) and IP configuration for each.

- The backend pool is where traffic will be distributed.

### Step 6: Load Balancing Rule

- Name: `lb-rule`
- Protocol: **TCP**
- Port: **80**
- Backend Port: **80**
- Associated the backend pool and health probe

### Step 5: Health Probe

- Created a health probe named `lb-health-probe` to continuously check if VMs are available and healthy on port 80. If a VM fails, traffic won‚Äôt be routed to it.
- Protocol: **TCP**
- Port: **80**
- Name: `lb-health-probe`

### Deployed Loadbalancer

- Successfully Deployed External Loadbalancer.
- The external load balancer is now ready to distribute traffic to backend VMs from the public internet.

### Step 7: Testing External LB

- After deployment, I tested the setup by hitting the public IP in the browser. Refreshed multiple times traffic successfully distributed between the two VMs.
- Accessed using public IP from browser

## Part B: Internal Load Balancer

Internal Load Balancer distributes traffic only within the virtual network, useful for backend services.

### Step 1: Create Internal Load Balancer

- Navigated to **Load Balancers ‚Üí Create**
- Named it: `internal-lb`
- Type: **Internal**
- Assigned a **Private IP address** within the subnet range (`lb-subnet`)
- Region: Central India

![internal-lb](./snapshots/task6-internal-lb.jpg)

### Step 2: Frontend IP configuration

Assigned a Static IP to access the webserver later

### Step 3: Backend Pool

- Used the same VMs as backend instances
- Ensured proper NSG rules allow internal traffic

![internal-backend-pools](./snapshots/task6-internal-backend-pool.jpg)

### Step 4: Internal Health Probe
Created a probe named `internal-health-probe` that checks for TCP connectivity on port 80.
- Protocol: **TCP**
- Port: **80**
- Named: `internal-health-probe`

### Step 5: Load Balancing Rule (Internal)
Configured a rule that distributes HTTP traffic (port 80) to backend pool members using the health probe.
- Protocol: **TCP**
- Port: **80**
- Associated backend pool and health probe

### Step 6: Successfully Deployed Internal Loadbalancer
Internal Load Balancer deployed successfully, ready to route traffic securely within the virtual network using .

### üß™ Step 5: Testing Internal LB

- Logged into one of the VMs
- Used `curl` command to hit internal load balancer's private IP:
```bash
curl http://<10.0.0.6:80>
```

![internal-lb-test](./snapshots/task6-internal-lb-success.jpg)
*Testing from inside the network confirms that the internal load balancer is correctly routing traffic.*

> **NOTE** We can access this from other VMs within the same virtual network as well.

## üßæ Conclusion

This task was a great opportunity to get hands-on with Azure Load Balancers. I not only followed the core steps but also **enhanced the security aspect** by using **private instances and Bastion Host** access ‚Äî even though it wasn‚Äôt explicitly required.
